# Professional Portfolio
My name is William Tyler Brown, and this is my portfolio which highlights the work and experiences that I have fulfilled in the Computer Information Systems program at University of Louisville - College of Business.
  - Currently, at school, I am a senior, graduating in May 2018, with a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration in Computer Information Systems with a focus in Information Security at the University of Louisville - College of Business.
  - Currently, at work, I am a Technology Intern at Humana, Inc. in Information Technology: Solution Engineering on a team classified as Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services Audit and Compliance IT. Our team achieves consistent, high-quality compliance reports derived from business files which are refined through our aggregation, validation, and reporting processes utilizing a combination of PL/SQL, Informatica, and .NET Framework. My core responsibilities are to support .NET development related to our Automated Universe Generation application in addition to assisting planning and implementation of new technologies.

Section I: Cover Letter & Resume
  - The Cover Letter, "WilliamTylerBrown_TechConsultant_CoverLetter.pdf", and Resume, "WilliamTylerBrown_Resume_9Apr2018.pdf", in this portfolio are directed to addressing the requirements and role essentials listed in the attached requisite from the employer, which is in the Requisite folder and titled "TechConsultant_Requisite.PNG".

Section II: Business & Systems Analysis
  - Cases: The Case Analyses provided in this portfolio come from Case Studies done by Harvard Business School and were assigned to be completed for a University of Louisville: College of Business course. These cases are organized by giving a brief overview of the organization the case study was written on followed by an analysis of the problem that the organization was facing regarding real life issues. After these are listed and described, an organizational competitive analysis is done using Porter's Five Forces, which are threat of new entrants, threat of substitutes, bargaining power of suppliers, bargaining power of buyers, and degree of competitive rivalry. Once this described along with the stakeholders, the alternatives to resolving the problem are analyzed for which would be best for the organization to put into action then my recommendation for which alternative to be utilized is described and the reasoning behind my thought process.
  - Project Deliverables for Kentucky Horsemen's Benevolent and Protective Association: This document is an analysis performed on the KYHBPAâ€™s requirements and current structure of their IT and website. The contents of this document are the system requirements, use cases, initial architecture considerations, risk analysis, and initial phase prototypes.

Section III: Database Design & Applications
  - Entity Relationship Diagrams: In relation to the SQL scripts folder is the ERD folder, which are used to design before implementation and to show the relationships and architecture of a Microsoft SQL Server database. These were designed in two different applications: Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio and Microsoft Visio. The ERD's display exactly how a database's data flows throughout an organization or in this case, our sample databases.
  - SQL Scripts: This SQL scripts/queries are results of assignments given by the CIS310: Database Design course. Within these files are examples of querying and managing data within a Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio database. The variety of difficulty and complexity portrayed in these scripts resemble the effort put forth by a beginner SQL developer, whom is just learning how to manage and query a MS SQL Server database.
  
Section IV: Web Development
  - KYHBPA Web Application: In the Web Development folder, there are two links that go to the Kentucky Horsemen's Benevolent and Protective Association's published website and the source code for that website. This project was implemented by a group of six to seven students based upon requirements. Each group member was given a role and I was selected as the Project Manager where my responsibilities included managing tasks, communicating with the client, and tracking progress for impending deadlines in addition to developing the application. The course assignment was a competition between five other groups to deliver a functional and visually appealing web application that achieves the requirements described by the client. Our group, Tech Lithe Creations, emerged as the winner and therefore, went forward in fully implementing and deploying this web application to the "production" environment.
